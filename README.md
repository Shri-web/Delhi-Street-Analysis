# Delhi Street Analysis

## Abstract 

The objective of this project was to analyze the street network of Delhi City using network centrality measures. The network was constructed from OpenStreetMap data using the NetworkX library in Python. Four different centrality measures were computed for each node in the network,including betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, degree centrality, and eigenvector centrality. The centrality values were then analyzed to identify the most important and influential nodes in the network.

The purpose of this project is to analyze the street network of Delhi City from OpenStreetMap using Python. The analysis is done using various network centrality measures such as betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, degree centrality, and eigenvector centrality. These measures provide insights into the importance and influence of individual nodes and edges in the street network.

## Data Collection 

The street network data for Delhi City is obtained from OpenStreetMap using the `osmnx` library in Python. The `osmnx` library allows for easy retrieval and manipulation of street network data from OpenStreetMap. The street network is extracted by specifying a bounding box around Delhi City using its latitude and longitude coordinates. The extracted street network is then visualized using the `osmnx` library to ensure that the correct network has been obtained.

## Tools Used :
-  NetworkX: A Python library for working with graphs and networks. It provides functions for constructing, analyzing, and visualizing graphs, as well as many algorithms for computing network measures such as centrality, clustering, and shortest paths.
- OSMnx: A Python library for working with OpenStreetMap data. It provides functions for downloading, parsing, and visualizing OpenStreetMap data, as well as tools for constructing street networks from the data.
